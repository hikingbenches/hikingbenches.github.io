## Adding new trails
To add a new trail, you need to create a post in the `/_posts` directory.  The file name format should be `YYYY-MM-DD-Trail-Name.md`.  Any images should be placed in a new directory in the `/images` directory.  Inside the post, follow this format:

```markdown
---
layout: trail
title: Post Title
trail_name: Trail Name
park_name: Park Name (optional)
park_location: Park Location (optional)
link: https://www.example.com (optional)
---

Post body
```

Put these changes in a new pull request and it will be reviewed soon after.  If approved, your changes will be merged and added to the blog.  If not approved, you will be informed of what changes to make to your pull request to get it approved.
